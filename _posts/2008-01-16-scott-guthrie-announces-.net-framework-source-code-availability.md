Thanks to [Josh Ambrose Little](http://dotnettemplar.net) for pointing out that [Scott Guthrie](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/) has blogged about [how to debug into the .Net Framework Library in Visual Studio 2008](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/01/16/net-framework-library-source-code-now-available.aspx).  I think the coolest thing is the ability to step into the Forms library (since I'm a forms guy).

I'm wondering how this will impact the MONO project.  Now they have specific code they can reference, although I'm sure it violates several user agreements.
