Sadly I had meant to post this back in February.

[20 Tips Every Business Should Know](http://www.qb4me.com/q?id=3412 "http://www.qb4me.com/q?id=3412")

Their #1 tip is serving a niche market.  While not a requirement for starting a business, you need to separate yourselves from your competition.  Whether it be in price, service or value.

#3 is something I can vouch for, outsourcing.  I commonly talk about the misconception of the word "outsourcing".  This doesn't necessarily mean an Indian in Bangalore is doing your work.  It does mean simple tasks such as bookkeeping or advertising can be performed by local resources around your town.

As you read through the rest of the tips, remember to not take them literally, but find alternatives to the solutions they suggest.
