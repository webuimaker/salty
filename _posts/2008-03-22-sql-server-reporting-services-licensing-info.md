After presenting at the [Tulsa SQL Server SIG](http://www.tulsasql.com/) I received the following question:

> According to all the blogs if you install SSRS on a web server it still burns up another SQL server license even if you don’t install SQL.  Our production SQL server costs like $30,000 for the enterprise version because it’s on an 8 core box.  The SharePoint server where I am trying to install SSRS also has 8 cores.  For SharePoint you have to install SSRS on the web server or it will not work.  Is there a cheap version of SSRS that won’t cost 30k?

Below was my response:

> Attached is a [document](http://download.microsoft.com/download/e/c/a/ecafe5d1-b514-48ab-93eb-61377df9c5c2/SQLServer2005Licensingv1.1.doc) I found detailed your licensing options.  Initially I thought you would not be able to get around buying an Enterprise license because it is the only version supporting 8 processors ([http://www.microsoft.com/sql/prodinfo/features/compare-features.mspx](http://www.microsoft.com/sql/prodinfo/features/compare-features.mspx)).  However, it says “Processor licenses are available in Enterprise, Standard, and Workgroup Editions and offer more simplicity for certain scenarios.”  So, you should only have to purchase a workgroup license for 8 processors.

> The real question is going to be if you can talk to the person responsible for purchasing/licensing to figure out how to buy the standard workgroup or standard license, plus the additional licensing for the additional processors.  Don’t forget, I’m betting there isn’t 8 processors, because of the newer multi core processors.  So make sure you verify the number of hard processors.
