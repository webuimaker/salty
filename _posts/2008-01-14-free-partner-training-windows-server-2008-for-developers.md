As I've mentioned countless number of times, one of the best benefits of the [Partner Program](http://partner.microsoft.com "Microsoft Partner Program") is training.Â  In this case it's free training.Â  Two days full of instructor led training for free, however right now it's only in 3 cities.

Topics covered:

> IIS 7  
> PowerShell and MMC 3.0  
> Software Licensing and Protection Services (SLP Services) - one of the more interesting topics rarely heard about  
> WCF (Windows Communication Foundation) or WWF (Windows Workflow Foundation)

Dates are as follows: (whomever in the world picked these locations should be flogged, note that there is no southern city)

> 1/29 - 1/30/2008 @ Downers Grove, IL
> 
> 2/12 - 2/13/2008 @ Waltham, MA
> 
> 2/21 - 2/22/2008 @ San Francisco, CA
