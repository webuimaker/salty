Ok, so my announcement is 6 days late.

I'm proud to announce that I received the coveted Microsoft MVP award for Visual Basic (currently the only MVP in Arkansas).  I'd first like to thank the Academy ... oh wait wrong speech again.  Actually I would like to thank the following people for their help and encouragement.  My apologies in advance if I neglected to mention you.

[**Travis Doyle**](http://www.gdhconsulting.com/)- for getting me interested and involved in starting the NWA DNUG  
[**Caleb Jenkins**](http://calebjenkins.com/) - for being encouraging during his tenure of Tulsa DNUG President and Microsoft Developer Evangelist  
[**Jay Smith**](http://jaysmith.us/)- for bringing that spirit of friendly competition and taking over the building of the NWA DNUG and doing an awesome job  
[**Jeremy Sharp**](http://letstalkcode.com/)- for being a terrific guy to hang out with  
[**Chris Koenig**](http://blogs.msdn.com/chkoenig)- probably the number one person responsible in helping me get the MVP award

and lastly .... **Ed Hickey** for allowing me to be an MVP!
