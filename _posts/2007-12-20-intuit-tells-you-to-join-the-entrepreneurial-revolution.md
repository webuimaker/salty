While doing my normal routine and checking out Facebook this morning, I happened to come across the What Kind of Entrepreneur Are You? Quiz.  Of course I had to take it, even though I was somewhat worried it would tell me "You have no entrepreneurial skills, get out now!"  Fortunately, I received the attached picture telling me I was a "Natural Born CEO".

Well the whole purpose of this posting was to tell you about Intuit's new initiative for startup companies.  You can download their free Simple Start 2008 edition (however why would you, when Microsoft's is better?).  You can also network and connect with others as well as get other free help.  It looks like it could be a decent resource.

Note that the entry period for the grant is over.
