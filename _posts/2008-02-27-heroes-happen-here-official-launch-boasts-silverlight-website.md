I received this today via e-mail.  You will eventually be able to watch the keynote and other speakers at the official west coast launch.  The Silverlight app is definitely more feature rich than many of the other Silverlight websites I've seen so far.  It's extremely interesting that you can create a "backpack" of videos.
