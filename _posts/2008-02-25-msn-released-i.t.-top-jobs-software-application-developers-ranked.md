MSN and CareerBuilder released an article titled "[Where the Jobs Are: Top Jobs in 10 Industries](http://msn.careerbuilder.com/custom/msn/careeradvice/viewarticle.aspx?articleid=1280&SiteId=cbmsnhp41280&sc_extcmp=JS_1280_home1&GT1=10884&cbRecursionCnt=1&cbsid=d34dbdc9fda440a9a56d1f373377c961-257299350-RD-4)".  I found it interesting that Information Technology was the first industry listed.  Below are the top 5 jobs listed for IT.  I also found it interesting that the growth for "computer applications software engineers" was a whopping 45% by 2016, a mere 8 years from now.  That's 5% per year.  So what exactly is a computer applications software engineer?  I'm guessing that it's a software developer / programmer for the desktop (non web based programming).  But that is only because they used the word "application".  As we all know, who are in the industry, applications are a mix of desktop and web technologies now, but I'm guessing they don't know that.  I can only guess they are referring to system drivers and other hardware interfacing software when they listed "Computer systems software engineers" but who knows ...  I definitely like the listed salaries, it's gone up from the $55-65k, I remember seeing 5-8 years ago.
