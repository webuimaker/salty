With the help of [Chris Koenig](http://blogs.msdn.com/chkoenig/) blog site, I was finally able to track down the link and information on how to submit a speaking proposal to TechEd 2008.

You may register using the following link, however you must contact me to get the code.  [https://2008.msteched.com/cft/](https://2008.msteched.com/cft/)

You will need the following information in order to submit a topic:

> Conference (Developers or IT Professionals)  
> Submitter Information (Name, Email, Company, URL, Title, Country) and Background  
> Speaker Information and Background  
> Topic Description  
> Conference  
> Track  
> Level  
> Product/Technologies  
> Session Type  
> Influencer


Here is some useful information to think about prior to submitting:  (I highly recommend you get a Microsoft employee to recommend your proposal)

> **Tech·Ed U.S. 2008 Call for Content**  
> Because Tech·Ed is now two conferences, you must decide which event is most appropriate for your session. After you have entered your session information, select the most appropriate technical track for your content to be categorized under. Select “Unsure” to have the Tech·Ed content team tag the appropriate track. Please note the track structure is subject to change, and your session will be re-categorized if necessary.  
> <u>Tips for Successful Submissions</u>
> 
> *   Write a descriptive, fun and enticing title
> *   Target 300-400 level technical content; 200 level content is in low demand
> *   Make sure your proposal is new, unique and/or refreshed content
> *   Take a solution oriented approach
> *   Align your topic to the technologies listed for the track
> *   Ensure there is no marketing in your content
> *   Showcase your speaking experience
> *   Focus on current technologies, which are those in beta and will be released to market prior to the next Tech·Ed
> *   High scoring sessions include one or more live demos
> 
> You are welcome to submit more than one proposal for content.
