For those that want your website to render correctly on IE8, the recent newsletter gave a great example for enforcing IE7 compatibility via a Meta tag.Â  (You can see the new IE logo above)


**Per Site Basis:**

Site owners and administrators can include the following custom HTTP header to display all pages in Internet Explorer 7 Strict mode for the site:

> X-UA-Compatible: IE=EmulateIE7

**Per-page basis:**

Site owners and administrators can include the following special HTML tag after the <Head> tag on the page:

> <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=EmulateIE7"/>
