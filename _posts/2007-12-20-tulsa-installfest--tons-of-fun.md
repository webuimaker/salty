A big thanks goes out to [Chris Koenig](http://blogs.msdn.com/chkoenig/) and the [Tulsa DNUG](http://www.tulsadnug.org) for hosting the Tulsa InstallFest on 12/3/2007.  Several of us from Northwest Arkansas .Net User Group traveled over there and participated in the fun.  A big shoutout to [Jay Smith](http://jaysmith.us) for volunteering and driving us over there.

Both Jay and I helped Chris register people for the event and I enjoyed getting to see some people I haven't seen in a while from the Tulsa DNUG.

Whatever Chris Koenig says about his drumming skills in Rock Band, DON'T BELIEVE HIM!  He definitely showed me up.
