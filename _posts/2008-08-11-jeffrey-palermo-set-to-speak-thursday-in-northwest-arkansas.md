For those that weren't able to attend last Tuesday's Northwest Arkansas .Net User Group meeting, 8/5/2008, Zach Young (our Vice President of the group) was able to secure Jeffrey Palermo as a speaker for a special meeting this Thursday (8/14/2008).  This is a huge boon, as Jeff is one of THE most sought after speakers in North America.  Jeff is most known for the [Party with Palermo](http://www.partywithpalermo.com/) series of events before each of the major conferences.

Jeff hails from Austin, Texas, which was recently named the hardest drinking city in America, go figure.  You can read his blog at [http://jeffreypalermo.com/](http://jeffreypalermo.com/ "http://jeffreypalermo.com/")
