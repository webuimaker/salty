While I love Microsoft's developer products, adCenter (Microsoft's search advertising / pay per click) makes me want to hide in shame.  See the email I received below.

I completely understand the desire of AdCenter to educate the masses, but do you really need a Workshop to get your customers to understand your product?  Much less, require them to PAY to attend?  Sure you might be giving a 50% credit towards advertising, but why would I pay to attend?  That's not the way to get customers to move from Google to AdCenter.

Why not give FREE online advertising and search engine seminars all across the U.S., not just 3 select cities.  Use the same principles that built up the developer community like the MSDN Events.
