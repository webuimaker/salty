It's always an honor to be asked to speak at an event.  Fortunately John Kellar who chairs the Nashville devLink event hasn't heard about my reputation, lol.

One of the many things I'm passionate about is software startups.  Since I haven't had a chance to talk about this subject in a while, I'm really looking forward to it.  If you have ever thought of or intend to start your own software business, then please attend.  I guarantee it'll be one of the most engaging talks you've experienced.

Here's a bio of the session:

**Starting & Running a Software Development Business**  
Join Randy Walker, owner of an ISV, as he leads an interactive discussion on his successes and failures of running a software business. We will discuss marketing strategies, sales cycles, employees, networking, competition, licensing, legal issues, intellectual property, ways to keep the largest profit margin and the Microsoft [Partner Program](http://partner.microsoft.com "Microsoft Partner Program").
