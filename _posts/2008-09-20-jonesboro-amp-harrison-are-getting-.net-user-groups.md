For those living in the Northeast Arkansas / Jonesboro and Harrison areas, there will be two new .Net User Groups.  Details are still pending, but if you’re interested in helping form or attend the meetings, be sure to contact me.  Helping lead user groups is a fantastic resume builder, and as anyone can attest, the social networking aspects is the number 1 reason to get involved.
