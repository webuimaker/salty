In my last post about joining the geekswithblogs community, I mentioned the [Community Credit](http://www.community-credit.com/) folks.  The wonderful thing about the GeeksWithBlogs is that it automatically submits blog postings for community credit.  I had originally thought I wasn't going to bother with it, after all who wants to enter in everything you do into their webform.  But since I only have to add manual things like organizing events and attending user groups, it makes it much easier.

I'm also working with David Silverlight to hopefully get his CS plugin to work with CS 2007!  Right now I'm in 11th place at Community Credit, but hopefully by tomorrow I'll be somewhere around 8th or 9th.

David Silverlight runs the following websites:
