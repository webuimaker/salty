INETA has a great gimmick.  Give someone a award and then recruit them to do volunteer work!  While I am completely joking, I was recently appointed to INETA’s Board of Directors.  Congratulations go out to my fellow Board Members.

Rob Zelt, President  
Mike Vincent, Vice President  
Scott Spradlin, Secretary  
Morgan Baker, Treasurer  
Steve Andrews, Director  
Lori McKinney, Director  
Randy Walker, Director  
Shawn Weisfeld, Director  
Chris Williams, Director

Our first order of business will be a Board Meeting in Raleigh, North Carolina from April 3rd to April 5th.  I have long recognized many of the problems INETA has had, and I hope to participate and help resolve them.  A majority of the issue revolves around the perception INETA has.  Things such as speaker requests becoming a black hole, requests come in, but no one knows what’s going on.  Many of the older established user groups don’t recognize value in INETA, something which I hope to help remedy.  Lastly, one of my goals is to provide more value to the user groups, such as a free website portal for all user groups.  If we can provide a free website portal/template with hosting and email, I think this will bring tremendous value to all user groups.

If you have ideas on how INETA can be improved, please shoot me an email or leave feedback.  We all want to see INETA improve, and that can only happen with your participation.
