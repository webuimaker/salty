Just received information that details the changes of the Microsoft Satisfaction Index.  This was one of the easiest ways to buildup Partner points and also receive information from your customers via survey.  It's been a while since I've used it, but I recall the points being much higher.  You can view information about the program at the following website: [https://microsoft.prognostics.com/MSPortal/Dashboard/Default.aspx](https://microsoft.prognostics.com/MSPortal/Dashboard/Default.aspx "https://microsoft.prognostics.com/MSPortal/Dashboard/Default.aspx").  Note that you must be a Microsoft Partner in order to view the information.
