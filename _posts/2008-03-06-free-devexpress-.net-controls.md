I ran across an ad today that linked me to where DevExpress is giving away over 40 controls for free.  I'm a big fan of two of their products (which unfortunately aren't free), CodeRush and their Excel like grid control.  Their grid control is a huge hit amongst the Excel heavy business users I typically deal with.

The free sets of controls you get are:

*   [The XtraEditors Library](http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/WinForms/XtraEditors/)
*   [The XtraNavBar Suite](http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/WinForms/XtraNavBar/)
*   [ASPxMenu](http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/WebForms/ASPxMenu/)
*   [ASPxSiteMapControl](http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/WebForms/ASPxSiteMapControl/)
