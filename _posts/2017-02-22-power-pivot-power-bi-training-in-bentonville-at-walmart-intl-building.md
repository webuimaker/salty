Here are Harvest, we’re proud of our partnerships.  Last year we were fortunate to help Walmart International bring in Rob Collie who wrote the book on [PowerPivot](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Start-the-Power-Pivot-in-Microsoft-Excel-add-in-a891a66d-36e3-43fc-81e8-fc4798f39ea8) for training.  We’re very fortunate he’s back here this year again for private on-site training that we are making available to our readers and customers.

### What is Power Pivot?

PowerPivot is a built-in Microsoft EXCEL Add In (2013 & 2016 versions, 2010 needs a download).  It works almost exactly like your normal Pivot tables except it allows you to use powerful [DAX](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/677.power-bi-data-analysis-expressions-dax-language.aspx) programming to handle millions of lines worth of data.  Yes, that’s right, you can now exceed your Excel line limits with Power Pivot and you’ve likely had the functionality all this time.

### Who’s providing the training?

Rob Collie is both an author and Microsoft awarded professional on PowerPivot.  You can view his blog here at [https://powerpivotpro.com/author/powerpivotpro/](https://powerpivotpro.com/author/powerpivotpro/ "https://powerpivotpro.com/author/powerpivotpro/")
