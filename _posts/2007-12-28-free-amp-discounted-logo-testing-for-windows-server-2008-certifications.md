Just as with Windows Vista logo program, Microsoft is either giving away free certifications or reducing the price on their Logo certifications for Windows Server 2008.  This time, they are calling it their Innovate on Windows Server initiative.

If you want your application tested for FREE, you must be one of the first 300 to submit by February 2008 and part of the ISV Microsoft Partner program (note that VeriSign will charge you money though).  This is only good towards the "Works with Windows Server 2008" program.  After February, the test fee is a mere $500 through June 30, 2008.

The Certified for Windows Server 2008 also has some significant discounts as well as some marketing benefits if you certify early.  You can read more about all of the benefits for both programs here on [Microsoft's website](http://microsoft.mrmpslc.com/InnovateOnWindowsServer/OverviewBenefits.aspx).

One of the things I noticed is different, is that you now have to use a [Microsoft Product Identification Tool](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=03726ec2-cc91-4e14-a827-4eee059efd5f&displaylang=en).  Note that these tests can be a real pain, but can alleviate your customers minds and give you some marketing capital (as in something to create buzz for your customers).

The next step is creating a Winqual Account with VeriSign, which will actually cost you some money.  The last time I attempted this program on Windows Vista, since my company is completely virtual, I had difficulties signing up with VeriSign.  We'll see if that continues as I attempt to do this program.  As such, I have a very bad view of VeriSign.  Especially considering their web certificates are so expensive.

The second to last step is signing up with either VeriTest or Wipro.  I haven't ever gotten this far, so I don't have any words of wisdom.

Lastly you're supposed to submit your test logs for verification.

I'll try and update you all as I go through the process.
