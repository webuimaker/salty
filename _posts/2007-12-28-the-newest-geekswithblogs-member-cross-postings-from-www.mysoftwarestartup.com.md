In my role as INETA Membership Mentor I hooked up with Jeff Julian while trying to process his Office User Group application through INETA.  I had heard about GeeksWithBlogs but hadn't ever had an opportunity get familiarize myself with it.  Jeff and I got to talking through e-mail and I joined as one of the members.  I am now cross-posting my technical posts there and since then my readership has gone up quite a bit.  Plus they've helped me automate some submittals to [www.community-credit.com](http://www.community-credit.com).  Hopefully I'll post more about Community Credit in a few days when they announce the winners for the month (I'm expecting to be one of the winners).

For those that didn't know, my blog site [www.mysoftwarestartup.com](http://www.mysoftwarestartup.com) focuses on helping entrepreneurial software developers with both my good and bad experiences of running my business.
