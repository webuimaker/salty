As of March 1st, 2008 Microsoft will force you to use the new way to access your MSDN subscription.  This is terrific news!  Since I have 3 people access MSDN from remote locations (out of my 5 user license), we've all had to sign into MSDN from a common Live id.  Microsoft is now requiring you to setup in the Partner management website 3 different technical contacts.  Once you setup those 3 different technical contacts ([https://partners.microsoft.com/PartnerProgram/ManagePeople.aspx?tab=8](https://partners.microsoft.com/PartnerProgram/ManagePeople.aspx?tab=8 "https://partners.microsoft.com/PartnerProgram/ManagePeople.aspx?tab=8")) they can then associate their Live id with their MSDN account.

This is great news because I would always have to sign out, then sign into the common MSDN user account in order to access subscription benefits.

So the question is, what do I do when I need to add 2 more people to access MSDN, which is part of my Partner MSDN 5 license benefits?  When or if I find out, I'll try and let you know.  Perhaps one of you can help enlighten me.
