I've often complained at the number of initiatives and incentives Microsoft's [Partner Program](http://partner.microsoft.com "Microsoft Partner Program") gives.  However it looks like they are cleaning it up just a tiny bit.  Microsoft is putting $10 behind their Big Easy Offer program.  Essentially if you upsell or cross-sell licensing you can benefit from it.

Basically Microsoft will send your customer a check, with your company's name on it.  The article I read didn't explain it in great detail, but it appears that it might make things more simple by aggregating a lot of Microsoft's subsidy programs.
