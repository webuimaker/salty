I came across an interesting video on the Today show.  I would share the link, but their I couldn't get their app to work correctly.  You can go to [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21134540/vp/22408386#22216642](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21134540/vp/22408386#22216642 "http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21134540/vp/22408386#22216642") and look for the Dec 12th video on "Why women love Geeks".  Evidently we are the new preferred dating type over the muscle bound meatheads.  I think we can thank Bill Gates for helping us all out.

You can view the article by Tango magazine about how Geeks are the new Chic here [http://www.tangomag.com/20072714/why-geeks-are-the-new-chic.html](http://www.tangomag.com/20072714/why-geeks-are-the-new-chic.html "http://www.tangomag.com/20072714/why-geeks-are-the-new-chic.html").

I had no clue, but there is even a new phrase called [Geek Chic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geek_chic)
