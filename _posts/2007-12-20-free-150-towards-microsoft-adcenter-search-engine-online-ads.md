As part of the Microsoft Windows Server 2008 Certification program, the Microsoft Partner Program is offering $150 credit to the first 5000 partners who sign up.  You can find out more here: [https://microsoft.mrmpslc.com/InnovateOnWindowsServer/KeywordAdvertising.aspx](https://microsoft.mrmpslc.com/InnovateOnWindowsServer/KeywordAdvertising.aspx "https://microsoft.mrmpslc.com/InnovateOnWindowsServer/KeywordAdvertising.aspx").

Note that it requires $5 to sign up.

Supposedly you can also receive $75 credit for signing up for the Microsoft Referral Program and $100 for each customer you sign up.  I'll talk more about this in a follow up blog.
