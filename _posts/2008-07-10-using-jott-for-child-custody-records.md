Having recently been through a somewhat distasteful divorce (all but being called an abusive and negligent father), I came to recognize the need to establish custody records while I have my son.  The need arises because I need proof of both my own and her actions.  This way she cannot call my integrity into question again, and should the need arise, I can use the records to establish her own pattern.  The various things I need to record are pickup and dropoff times, interaction with his mother (a very very important task), and basically record everything I do with him.

After a search on the Internet and briefly perusing the software offerings, I determined that none of them were adequate.  They were all hard to use, not very feature rich, or just plain junk.  I had thought about recording things in my Outlook calendar (I already use it to schedule the times I have my son), but thought that backing it up and searching for records would be too difficult.  Then I remembered [Jott](http://www.jott.com).  I already use it to remind myself of to-dos, why not use it for my custody records?

So what is [Jott](http://www.jott.com)?  [Jott](http://www.jott.com) essentially allows you to send a text email with your voice.  How it works is, you call their phone number, tell them who you want to send a message to, and then tell [Jott](http://www.jott.com) what the message is.  It will do all of the voice translation to text for you.  Now the caveat is, you have to tell [Jott](http://www.jott.com) all of your contacts and their email addresses.  But for the case of making notes for yourself, when you call in and it asks, "Who do you want to [Jott](http://www.jott.com)?" you just answer "myself".

Now in the case of custody records, all I have to do is call [Jott](http://www.jott.com) with my cell phone and make a quick note of what just happened concerning my son or his mother.  The record will get sent to my email and I just move that email to an archive folder.
