Just think about how much greenhouse gasses you can save if you don't fire up the fireplace, but instead turn your TV on and watch your favorite Yule Log show.  Set your DVR to WGN from 1:30 to 4:30 or you can watch it all day on Christmas on MOJO in HD from 6AM to 8PM.  There are a few local TV stations that also broadcast it, so check your cable or satellite provider.

You can find out more about the history of the Yule log by visiting [Slate](http://www.slate.com/id/2179709/?GT1=10733) and watching their video.  If you didn't know, the Yule Log is a tv show of a fire burning in a fireplace.  I suppose the old screensaver of an aquarium got it's origins from the Yule Log.

I wish you all a Merry Christmas and hope you remember the real reason for the season, celebrating Christ's birth.
