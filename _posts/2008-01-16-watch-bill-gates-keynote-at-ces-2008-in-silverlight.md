I'm impressed by the fact that they used Silverlight to highlight Bill Gates keynote and Microsoft at CES.  Note that the intro is a bit long before they actually let him speak.  If you'll notice at the bottom, they included all of the tags for their products they are highlighting.  The only logo I questioned was Microsoft Office.  How in the world is Office linked to entertainment?

I think my favorite bit was about Microsoft Bob
