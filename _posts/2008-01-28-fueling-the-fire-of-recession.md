After reading the January 24th edition of the Redmond Channel Partner newsletter, I was rather dismayed at the magazine's top article titled "Reader Feedback: You Are Preparing for a Recession".  You can read the originating blog post [here](http://rcpmag.com/blogs/weblog.aspx?blog=1850).  President Bush isn't the smartest man out there, but he knew when he took office the first time, in order to get out of a recession you have to encourage spending.

I keep hearing all this talk about a recession and "preparing" for it.  But frankly I'm quite shocked at how people would rather prepare for dark times than encourage good times.  I'm a huge Chris Farley fan, and in my immature youth I learned something very important from one of his movies, as stupidly funny as it may have been.  Tommy Boy featured Callahan Auto, a business that was experiencing tough times.  But the critical piece of information that I think we should all learn from his movie is that when business is on a downward slide, it's time to expand.

Apply that lesson to our recession, and I think it's a great time for all of our business to expand.  Manpower, materials, and loans will be cheaper, and there's no better time to do it now.
