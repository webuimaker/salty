The date & location is set!  May 3rd at the Addison Conference Center in Addison (Dallas suburb) Texas.  This event used to be known as the Dallas Code Camp.  I'm actually really excited by this event, since befitting the DFW area's size, it will finally have a free technology event just as big.

If you're familiar with the Tulsa TechFest event, it should be of similar format, but much bigger attendance.

More information to follow as I hear about it.  I should be seeing some of the organizers this weekend so hopefully I can garner some details this weekend.
