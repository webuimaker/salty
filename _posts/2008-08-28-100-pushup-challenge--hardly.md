So there's some manly competition going around the Geek community.  Evidently [Chris Williams](http://geekswithblogs.net/cwilliams/) challenged [Darcy Lussier](http://geekswithblogs.net/dlussier/archive/2008/08/19/124558.aspx) to do the [100 Pushup Challenge](http://hundredpushups.com/index.html).  What kind of junk is this challenge?  Over the past couple of months, I've been working on both pushups, situps and squats, with NO BREAKS.  I'm up to about 35 of each.  But isn't having all of these breaks between sets of 10 and 15 pretty wussy?  Ok ok, so each of them outweigh me by 100 pounds, and can toss me around like a rag doll, but pahleeze, 100 Pushups that way is no challenge!
