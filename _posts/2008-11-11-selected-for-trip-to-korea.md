Having only told a handful of people, I applied to the OKF (Overseas Korean Foundation) for the “First Trip Home” program the week of the deadline in late October.  I found out about the program late and rushed to get my application in, which included gathering documents and writing an essay.  It’s been over 36 hours since I found out I was selected to participate, and I’m still a bit shell shocked.  Please note that this event in my life is extremely personal and something I have not fully explored.

OKF and the First Trip Home program was designed for “… inviting Korean adoptees to their motherland to experience and learn Korean culture by creating an outlet for their desire for searching for their identity, assistance with searching for their biological family …”  [http://www.okf.or.kr/](http://www.okf.or.kr/ "http://www.okf.or.kr/eng/new/notice/notice_01_list.jsp?biID=newsE&mode=V&bID=8008")

I’m very fortunate to have been one of the 44 selected.  Both the flight and hotel accommodations are being paid through the Foundation which was setup by the Korean government.  I’m still waiting on the itinerary, as they are scheduling several events for us.  Tentatively the dates I’ll be in Korea is from Dec 8th – Dec 14th, which will require a day of travel to arrive and a day to return.  It’ll be a long and difficult journey, one of some self exploration and discovery.  Please pray for me.

I’ll be posting more about this journey on my personal site and Facebook, however will be exclude the <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">geekswithblogs.net</span> community.  Feel free to keep track of the postings on [http://mysoftwarestartup.com](http://mysoftwarestartup.com)
