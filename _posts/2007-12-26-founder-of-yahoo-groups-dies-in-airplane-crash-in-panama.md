Michael Klein's plane was found on Christmas Day containing the bodies of his 13 year old daughter, pilot and himself.  Michael Klein was the President and CEO of eGroups, Inc. before it was sold to Yahoo! in 2000 and is now known as Yahoo! Groups.  He was traveling to or from his personal eco resort in Panama when the plane went down.  The survivor was a friend of his daughter.

While this doesn't have any current impact on technology, I found that it was interesting, if not ironic in some sense.  He was 37 when he died, not much older than I or a majority of other industry influencers.  And I say ironic because just like rock singers who make it rich, he too died in a plane crash.  It's definitely sad that his daughter passed away since it leaves her mother behind.  But at least the girl's friend is going to live.
