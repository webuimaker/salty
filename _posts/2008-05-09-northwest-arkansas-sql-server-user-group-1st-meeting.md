I have vastly been neglecting my blogging.  So as not to be outdone by [Chris Koenig](http://blogs.msdn.com/chkoenig) ....

I was able to meetup with the organizers of the event, Jason Pluenneke, Curt Wolfe, Boyd Evert, & Dennis Berk several weeks ago.  I am personally very excited about this new user group starting up.  Partly because of my small part in helping them (one of my roles as the INETA Membership Mentor), but mostly because of my passion for databases.  I'm really looking forward to what will be coming out of the group.

I will be donating several swag items, if you haven't already been enticed into attending.  There will be a free copy of the Heroes Happen Here bundle which includes licensed copies of SQL Server 2008, Visual Studio 2008 and Windows Server 2008.  I'm also bringing a copy of PC-Cillin Anti Virus, an MSDN t-shirt, and a Visual Studio t-shirt.  Chris Koenig is also sending some swag to be given away.
