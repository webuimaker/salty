I wanted to thank David Silverlight for doing a wonderful service to the programming community.

For my involvement in the world wide programmer community, I was awarded the 6th place prize of a "Chuck" TV show T-shirt that says "My Entire Life" on a 3.5" floppy disk.  David created <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">Community-Credit.com</span> with the sole purpose of awarding "Stupid Prizes to Smart People".  You are awarded points for helping the programmer community out, and at the end of the month whomever hast the most points are awarded prizes.  This was my first month to participate.

January 2008 contest features a cool Podcast Kit, and what looks to be my favorite, an iLounge Toilet Paper Dispenser for your iPod.  You can check it all out [http://www.community-credit.com/](http://www.community-credit.com/ "http://www.community-credit.com/").  For those of you who are heavily involved in the community but aren't taking part in the contest, David has created several ways to automatically log blog posts for credit.

You can find out various ways to earn extra points at [http://www.community-credit.com/](http://www.community-credit.com/ "http://www.community-credit.com/cs/blogs/community_credit_news/archive/2007/12/30/How-do-I-earn-some-extra-points_3F00_.aspx")
