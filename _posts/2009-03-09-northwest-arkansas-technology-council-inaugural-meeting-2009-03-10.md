> You are invited to participate in the formation meeting of the Northwest Arkansas Technology Council (NWA Tech Council), set for March 10th, 2009 from 6-8pm at the Arkansas World Trade Center (3300 Market Street, Suite 400, Rogers Arkansas 72758).  The NWA Tech Council’s purpose is to encourage business growth of the technology sector in Northwest Arkansas.
> 
> Originally several of us set out to put on an event called the Northwest Arkansas Technology Summit, a broad based event connecting all aspects of technology that appeal to the larger firms in this area including Wal-Mart, JB Hunt, Tyson, small and medium businesses, and vendor communities. The event was originally scheduled for June 2009 at the John Q. Hammons Center. After further review, it was decided that in order to put on an event of the quality and magnitude that was envisioned, more time and planning would be needed.
> 
> The vision for the Northwest Arkansas Information Technology Summit includes the following aspects:  
> •    To be a nationally recognized event that pulls not only a regional, but national attendance. Goal: 1400+ attendees  
> •    To be sponsored by national recognized manufacturers (i.e. HP, Oracle, SAP, Microsoft, Dell, etc.)  
> •    To focus on new technologies and trends within the IT Community (i.e. Virtualization, Sustainability, etc.) and encourage vendors/manufacturers to showcase their latest and greatest  
> •    To have breakout sessions with 12 unique tracks. Some of the suggested tracks include: Retail Link, Project Management, Database Management, Software Development, Web Development, Infrastructure, Small Business, Digital Graphics, and Marketing  
> •    To have keynote speakers that can speak to how technology not only effects but empowers all business, from local small business to large worldwide enterprises
