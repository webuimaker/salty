I came across the information from the latest MSDN Flash.  The information contained is awesome.  Finally you have a guide to show you how to implement TFS into an organization.  I believe the MSDN Flash states it perfectly

> "It's a collaborative effort between patterns & practices, Team System team members, and industry experts that shows you how to incrementally adopt TFS for your organization. "

> There is also a related [Visual Studio Team System Guidance Project](http://www.codeplex.com/VSTSGuidance)

I hope you enjoy it, I intend to as soon as I get a chance to read it all.  Please postback a review of if you do.
