Great quote.  Be careful what you ask for, but most importantly recognize the opportunities you've been presented with.

> If someone prays for patience, do you think God gives them patience, or does he give them the opportunity to be patient?  If he prays for courage, does God give him courage, or the opportunity to be courageous?  If someone prays for the family to be closer, do you think God zapps them with warm fuzzy feelings, or does he give them opportunities to love each other?
