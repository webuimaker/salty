The MSDN Flash e-Newsletter has been updated with a reorganization of the way it is laid out.  One of the most surprising things was a familiar mug at the top of the page featuring Zain Naboulsi, our MSDN and X-Box Evangelist for our area.  Congratz on the feature Zain!

It was terrific seeing the User Group section being second on the list, which will hopefully drive more people to attending our events.

You can register for the newsletter [here](https://profile.microsoft.com/RegSysProfileCenter/wizard.aspx?wizid=920d2536-189f-43b2-bfcc-81c140c846f0&lcid=1033&fu=http%3a%2f%2fprofile.microsoft.com%2fpersonalization%2fapplications%2fmsdnsync%2fSyncProfile.aspx%3fst%3d1%26ru%3dhttp%253a%252f%252fgo.microsoft.com%252ffwlink%252f%253fLinkId%253d76881%2526clcid%253d0x409&cu=http%3a%2f%2fgo.microsoft.com%2ffwlink%2f%3fLinkId%3d76885%26clcid%3d0x409).
