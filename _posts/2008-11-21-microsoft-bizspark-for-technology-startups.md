I love it when someone else writes up my blog postings for me!




Microsoft BizSpark is a global program designed to help accelerate the success of early stage startups.

By joining BizSpark, Startups get:

o **<u>Software</u>:**  fast and easy access to Microsoft’s current **full-featured development tools**, platform technologies, and **production licenses of server** products for immediate use in developing and bringing to market innovative and interoperable solutions with _no upfront costs and minimal requirements._ Startups will also get access to the community technology preview (CTP) of the **Microsoft Azure Services Platform**.

o **<u>Support</u>**:  professional technical support from Microsoft (MSDN) and community support from BizSpark Network Partners around the world who provide a wide range of support resources for software startups.  Network Partners are incubators, investors, advisors, government agencies and hosters who are vested in software-fueled innovation and entrepreneurship.

o **<u>Visibility</u>**:  global visibility to an audience of potential investors, clients and partners.  Startups will have the opportunity to complete a profile in the online Startup directory, BizSparkDB, on the Microsoft Startup Zone which highlights promising companies from around the world, including “**BizSpark Startup of the Day”**.

Startups get access to BizSpark either through a Network Partner (e.g. TiE, NVCA, select Venture Capitalists, and over 300+ entrepreneurial-focused organizations) or through Microsoft BizSpark Program Leads (called “BizSpark Champs”). Startups can find both at [Microsoft.com/bizspark](http://www.microsoft.com/bizspark).
