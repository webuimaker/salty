I just saw this commercial while watching the Sugar Bowl.  While very true about the kicker position in school sports, our tech life is much the same way.  Corporate America hates to spend money in their IT department, thinking of us as an expensive "expense".  But when there is a problem, we're the first ones to hear it and the last ones to get praises.  Such is our life, underappreciated, underpaid and underutilized.
