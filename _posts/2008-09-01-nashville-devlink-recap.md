One of the most interesting things about being a software developer is to see the entire undercurrent and subculture of the industry.  It really makes it more visible at the local geek gatherings, regional and national conferences.  This year I felt extremely fortunate to have been offered an opportunity to speak and help at the Nashville / Murfreesboro [devLink](http://www.devlink.net/) conference.  I honestly hadn't intended on going due to the 9 hour travel required, but when my good friend [John Kellar](http://johnkellar.blogspot.com/) reached out, how could I refuse?  So [David Mohundro](http://www.mohundro.com/blog/), [Michael Johnson](http://michaelcodes.net/) and myself made the long trek.  (David and Michael belong to the Fort Smith .Net User Group)

Other highlights ...  [![Main Hall during the opening keynote, also where I presented my topic, fortunately there wasn't as many people](http://gwb.blob.core.windows.net/rwalker/WindowsLiveWriter/NashvilledevLinkRecap_D4F6/DSC00919_thumb_1.jpg)](http://gwb.blob.core.windows.net/rwalker/WindowsLiveWriter/NashvilledevLinkRecap_D4F6/DSC00919_1.jpg)  
I got thrown out of the speaker room for making too much noise by the [Deep Fried Bytes](http://deepfriedbytes.com/) crew, they were recording for their podcast (not completely accurate, but hey, it makes for a good story).  
John Kellar and the rest of the devLink crew, puts on a darn good event!  
I participated in the recording for DotNetRocks during the Saturday night after party!  
Open Spaces was a huge hit, lead by [Alan Stevens](http://netcave.org/)  
Had a terrific time meeting and talking with [Billy Hollis](http://www.dotnetmasters.com/)  
The Heartland Microsoft Developer Evangelist crew is an awesome bunch!  
I graduated from the same high school that the devLink Secretary [Leanna Baker](http://www.the-bakers.com/) did, small world eh?  
My session that I spoke at was in the main hall (picture right), fortunately I didn't have that entire crowd
