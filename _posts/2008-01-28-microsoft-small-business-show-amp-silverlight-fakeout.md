Microsoft is on their 2nd Small Business Show which features "Solutions for Entrepreneurs".  You can view the show [here](http://www.microsoft.com/smallbusiness/show/).

I thought it was interesting that up in the top left Microsoft tells you to Install Silverlight (competitor to Adobe Flash).  Yet if you notice at the bottom of the popup menu, the show is displayed in Flash.  Hopefully they'll rectify that soon.
