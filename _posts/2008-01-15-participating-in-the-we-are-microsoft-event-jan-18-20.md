Please come join us at the Charity event "We Are Microsoft".  Throughout the weekend, starting this Friday, we will be working on charity software development.  Right now [Mark Leon Watson](http://www.markwatson.net/) and I will be working on <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">Irving.Net</span> web project, and I'm looking forward to working with someone whom I've only ever met online.

If you live in the Northwest Arkansas area, there will be four of us going, and I'm betting we could find more room to carpool if you are interested.  We will be leaving sometime Friday morning to make the trek.
