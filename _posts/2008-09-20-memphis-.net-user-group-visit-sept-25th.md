For those in East Arkansas and West Tennessee, I’ll be visiting the [Memphis .Net User Group](http://memphisdot.net/) on September 25th 2008.  [David Mohundro](http://www.mohundro.com/blog/), the co-founder of the Fort Smith .Net User Group, will be presenting on PowerShell.  You won’t want to miss this presentation, as there is some terrific tie-ins with Visual Studio.

My main purpose will be to meet with the guys starting up a Northeast Arkansas .Net User Group in Jonesboro, Arkansas.  If you’re interested, in helping out or attending the new NEADNUG group, be sure to contact me.

David and I will be traveling together and staying with [Colin Neller](http://www.colinneller.com/blog/), who has graciously/foolishly opened his home to us.  A big shoutout of thanks to Colin and his family.

Hope to see you in Memphis!
