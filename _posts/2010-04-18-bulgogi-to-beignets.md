While it’s still a full month away, I’m getting super excited about my upcoming trips.

May and June are chock full of events, two of which I’ll have full announcements for within the week.  In mid May I’ll be driving to Dallas to take my 2nd trip to Korea (the bulgogi part).  Seeing a bunch of old friends from my first trip as well as taking a week for some deeper personal things.

While in my absence, June 1st-4th, I’ve setup a tour across Arkansas and Texas for two Microsoft employees who work on the Visual Studio & Visual Basic team to talk at various user groups and companies.  Look for my announcement within the next couple of days.

As soon as I get back from Korea, I’m off to New Orleans!  It’s been years since I’ve been there (pre-Katrina), and I have a hankering for some Beignets and Cafe Ole from Cafe Du Monde.  The big news?  **I’m hosting a PARTY on Bourbon Street!**  The party will be very exclusive, featuring a crawfish and shrimp boil, various Cajun dishes, and an open bar.  Huge thanks to Infragistics for putting up the initial sponsor money.  See you guys at Microsoft’s TechEd 2010!
