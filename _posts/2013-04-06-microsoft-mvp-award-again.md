Normally April 1st is filled full of practical jokes and funny stuff with Google being the most notorious about the scams they try to pull.  This year Google tried to trick us into believing a new product called [Google Nose](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbYadm_mrw&hl=en).  I love when they say “Our mobile aroma indexing program.” It makes it sound all official like.

Oddly though, my renewal as a Microsoft MVP Award winner coincides with April 1st.  Fortunately I’m happy to announce I’ve received my 6th consecutive award.  To read more about the program and please visit’s Microsoft’s new MVP website at [http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/overview.aspx](http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/overview.aspx "http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/overview.aspx").  As with all awards, I couldn’t have done it without the sincere help of numerous people in the software development community.
