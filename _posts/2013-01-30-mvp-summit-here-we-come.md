It’s always my favorite time of the year!

Looking forward to bringing my wife to the largest events for Microsoft MVP Award winners.  Each year is a plethora of knowledge and getting to know who the best and brightest are in the Microsoft community.  In some small way I’m hoping my wife will be excited to see this world, but she admit’s she’s a tad nervous.  See you all soon!
