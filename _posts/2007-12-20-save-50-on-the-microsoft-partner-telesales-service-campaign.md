I received this in the Microsoft Partner e-Newsletter:

> **[Save 50% on a Partner Telesales Service Campaign](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=7912597)**
> 
> Are you a Gold or Certified ISV partner with an application that runs on Microsoft SQL Server 2005 or with a security, management, or virtualization solution, running on the latest commercially available version of Microsoft products? If so, we have a great opportunity for you save 50 percent off of the regular list price of $8,600 for a Partner Telesales service campaign. This special, limited time offer is only available to the first 120 partners who respond and agree to the campaign terms. [Email us today](mailto:v-lucib@microsoft.com)

I was one of the lucky few who received one of these campaigns for free from Microsoft for being one of the first to sign up for a special program.  While it has yet to generate any sales, the community talk about it plus the sales lead list was immensely valuable.  I had lunch with someone the other day who kept hearing good things about my company that she wanted to follow up with us.  Probably the most valuable thing it gave me was implanting potential customers with my company's name so when they are ready to look for a solution, they'll remember me.  The $4300 is well worth it.
