August 22-23

For those that don't know, [devLink](http://www.devlink.net/) in Nashville is one of the best (if not THE best) community driven conferences out there.  I'm super excited to have been invited by [John Kellar](http://www.anvilsystems.com/Blog/tabid/114/Default.aspx) to host a couple of the Open Spaces sessions.  If you haven't gotten a chance to know John, he's a super guy and is helping to put on other conferences as well.  So while devLink may be sold out this year, be sure to sign up early next year!  At $50 this year, what a steal to get in to see the top speakers in the nation!

If you're in the Northwest Arkansas and River Valley area and have already reserved a spot at devLink, let me know since we'll be carpooling down there.
