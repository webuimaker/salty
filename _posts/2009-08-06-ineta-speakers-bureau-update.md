As most of you know, I serve on the INETA (International .Net Association) Board of Directors, being in charge of the Speakers Bureau and other Speaker programs.  There have been several rumors floating around with a lot of misconceptions and I wanted to clarify a few things.

The budget numbers have come in, and the U.S. National **Speakers Bureau budget is less than half** of what it was last year.  **I can personally guarantee that User Groups will continue to have speakers funded by INETA.**  However, we will be finding a way to stay within budget, and that means change will come.

Until we iron out all of the details of the new budget, we are Temporarily placing a hold on new speaker requests.  I strongly encourage you to make use of the new Regional Speaker Program until such time that it can be restored.
