Please join me in Tulsa on October 9th & 10th for the annual Tulsa TechFest event!  I’ve had several people ask me about when I’ll be doing my Small Business talk again, which will be on Oct 9th at 1pm.  If you are interested in starting your own software business, you won’t want to miss this!

Here’s a brief synopsis:

> Join Randy Walker, owner of an ISV, as he leads an interactive discussion on his successes and failures of running a software business. We will discuss what’s needed to start a software business including – marketing, tax issues, sales cycles, employees, networking, competition, licensing, legal issues, intellectual property, ways to keep the largest profit margin and the Microsoft [Partner Program](http://partner.microsoft.com "Microsoft Partner Program").
