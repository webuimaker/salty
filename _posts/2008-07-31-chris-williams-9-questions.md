For those that are unaware, [Chris Williams](http://geekswithblogs.net/cwilliams/), a fellow VB MVP does a 9 Questions series with fellow developers and influencers.  I was extremely honored to be picked this week and hope you find the series as interesting as I do.  Chris is also an active participant in the VB Insider's List Serv and actively gives feedback to the Visual Basic team in Redmond.

You can read my answers to his 9 questions over at <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">GeeksWithBlogs.net</span> at [http://geekswithblogs.net/cwilliams/archive/2008/07/31/124151.aspx](http://geekswithblogs.net/cwilliams/archive/2008/07/31/124151.aspx "http://geekswithblogs.net/cwilliams/archive/2008/07/31/124151.aspx")
