title:  "Microsoft kills off adCenter Affiliate program (paid referrals to their advertising engine)"

I received an e-mail (copied below) about Microsoft ending the paid referrals to new subscribers of adCenter.  I find this extremely perplexing because of Google's dominance in this area, plus Microsoft's bid for Yahoo!.  The number one reason for Microsoft to buy Yahoo! is so it can merge the two online advertising programs.

So why kill the one program that helps encourage people to use their online advertising?  At least this program encouraged me to list it and recommend it, whereas I never would have before.  Perhaps some of can shed some light on the subject.  Note that they are still paying for subscribers to their toolbar and virus service, two services that I will not be referring to any customers.
