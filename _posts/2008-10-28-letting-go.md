Being the Type A personality I am, one of the hardest things for me to do is to “Let Go”.  Why is letting go such an important thing?

For the small business owner, if you don’t let go, you’ll never grow your business.  For the parent, if you don’t let go, your child will never learn, grow, mature, or be independent.  For the software developer, if you don’t let go, you’ll never finish your product.  But most importantly, if you don’t let go, you’ll never move on, stuck in the same spot.

The following quote was written by an unknown author and was given to me by a friend.  I think it’s an extremely important lesson and I hope it helps you in your life.

> **<u>Let Go and Let God
