Wanted to say what an awesome idea this was by fellow geek Javier Lozano.  Javier started translating a C# compiler that you can write and program in Spanish.  Perhaps with some community urging he could start an open source project with a full translation engine so you can select your language of choice.  However I am completely bummed that it's not in VB!
