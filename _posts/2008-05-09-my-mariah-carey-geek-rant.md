So if Mariah Carey is going to feature us Geeks on her videos, the least she could do is get her geekspeak right!  I mean sheezh, who uses 802.11a anyway?  (mentioned at the end of the video)  The geek in the video needs to upgrade her firmware to 802.11n!  Oh wait, I think her doctor already upgraded her "firmware".

Well, we (us geeks) should all be happy at least.  We finally got the jocks off the music videos.  So does this finally lend legitimacy to the new Geek Era, or just make fun of us?  In either case, my Guitar Hero is going in the trash (as soon as I find a Mariah Carey expansion pack).
