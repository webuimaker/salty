As most of you know, Microsoft gives MVP awardees access to some great benefits.  I’ll admit, this is the first time I’ve used it to have access to something fun and non-work related.  While I only had the opportunity to play it twice (it’s just hard to find the time to play games), the new Age of Empires Online game is quite interesting.  I was able to play it during it’s Alpha stage, and it’s now hit the closed Beta stage, which we’ve been encouraged to invite people to apply for.  [http://www.ageofempiresonline.com/](http://www.ageofempiresonline.com/ "http://www.ageofempiresonline.com/")

If you get accepted, let me know what you think.
